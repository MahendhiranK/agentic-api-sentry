## Agentic Decision Flow

1. Client sends an API request
2. Request is intercepted at the runtime boundary
3. Context is extracted without modifying the request
4. Agent evaluates intent, policy, and risk
5. Decision is returned to the enforcement layer
6. Request proceeds, adapts, or terminates based on decision

The agent operates deterministically using predefined logic, enabling predictable behavior in regulated environments.
