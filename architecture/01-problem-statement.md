## Problem Statement

Enterprise APIs operate in environments where governance, compliance, and adaptability are mandatory. Traditional enforcement mechanisms rely on static rules embedded in gateways or application code.

This creates several challenges:
- Tight coupling between governance and business logic
- Limited runtime adaptability
- Inconsistent enforcement across services
- High operational risk in regulated systems

Agentic API Sentry addresses these challenges by introducing an external runtime control layer that evaluates API behavior contextually and enforces decisions without modifying services.
