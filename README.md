# Agentic API Sentry (.NET 8) ![CI](https://github.com/MahendhiranK/agentic-api-sentry/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

**Agentic API Sentry** is a lightweight, **static, mission-bound agent** that evaluates any **OpenAPI 3.0 specification** for governance and compliance readiness.  
It helps architects, developers, and DevOps teams ensure API specs meet **quality, security, and observability standards** before moving into production.

## Overview
Works with or without an LLM. The v1 rules are code-based. If you add an LLM, it will summarize findings.  

Modern enterprises rely on APIs, but ensuring they are **secure, compliant, and resilient** is often overlooked.  
Agentic API Sentry bridges this gap by acting as an **immutable agent** that runs a fixed set of checks on any OpenAPI spec and generates actionable reports.  

This approach is especially useful for **regulated industries** (finance, healthcare, government) where **determinism and auditability** are critical.  

## ðŸš€ Features (V1)
- **Spec Linting** â€“ Validates OpenAPI definitions, summaries, responses, and parameters.  
- **Security Checks** â€“ Detects missing HTTPS servers, absent security schemes, or undocumented 401/403 responses.  
- **Rate-Limit Detection** â€“ Identifies headers like `X-RateLimit` in API responses.  
- **Safe Sampling** â€“ Optionally probes up to 5 GET endpoints when a base URL is provided.  
- **Reporting** â€“ Generates both Markdown (`out/report.md`) and JUnit (`out/results.junit.xml`) outputs for CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Static Agent Execution** â€“ Tools and mission are bound at runtime and cannot be altered, ensuring predictable behavior.

## âš¡ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)  
- (Optional) Internet access for loading remote OpenAPI specs  

### Run
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/agentic-api-sentry.git
cd agentic-api-sentry

# Build
dotnet build

# Evaluate sample Bank API spec
dotnet run --project src/AgenticApiSentry -- samples/bank.yaml

# Outputs
# - out/report.md
# - out/results.junit.xml

# Enable safe GET sampling with explicit base URL
dotnet run --project src/AgenticApiSentry -- samples/bank.yaml --baseUrl https://api.demo-bank.com/v1
```

## LintSpec
**Severity:** warn  
2 potential issues  
- /payments post: missing 401/403 error responses  
- /transactions get: missing detailed response description  

## SecurityChecks
**Severity:** warn  
2 potential security gaps  
- No explicit security schemes defined for operations (only global placeholder)  
- /accounts/{accountId} get: no documented 401/403 responses  

## RateLimitHint
**Severity:** info  
No explicit rate-limit headers detected in responses

```

## Roadmap
- [ ] HTML report output  
- [ ] OpenTelemetry spans for observability  
- [ ] Policy-as-code (YAML/JSON) for custom rules  
- [ ] Postman collection export  
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Actions & Azure Pipelines
